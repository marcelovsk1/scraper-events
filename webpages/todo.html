# === DE-DUPLICATE EVENTS ===
# 1. similarity test of event names --> find a library that calculates a similarity score bewteen strings
# for example: "New Year Party" = "NY Party"
# 2. if we have troubles with this way, we could do embeddings but that is slighty more difficult to implement

# === FORMAT ELEMENTS (we have to check how is this formatted in the database) ===
# 1. Date -> Python datetime Object
    # if events from the same website have their date formatted the same way, then you could make a special formatting function
    # for each website
    # Facebook: "Fri 3, October" => function to output day, month, year =>> ({ day: 3, month: 10, year: null }) // 2024
    # you can use those elements to create a new datetime object in python which will be use to save the date in the database in the same way as the other dates

# 2. Location
    # a. If it's stored as simple string, then we could be fine
        # maybe we still need to do some cleaning to format location the same way (Montreal <> MontrÃ©al)
    # b. If we need coordinates, or more information on the location, or to format it the same way
        # I would use Google Places API which take as input an unformated dalocationte and returns a formatted place
        # it has a cost but it's usefull (like Google Maps)

# 3. Image URL
    # => no special need but depending on the current way of saving image
    # we would need to save the image in our own servers like the other images

# make a list of duplicate events to compare

# scrape secondary pages

# gpt prompt for generating tags from title and description

# see how to split start and end
# go learn about Regex https://regexr.com/ -> this way you would create an expression that will extract what you want from a string
# google places API

# delete # for tags


# could we consider that events that occur at the same place at the same time are the same event

1. Title

This code snippet checks whether a Facebook event title already exists in a
list of unique titles. If the title is already in the list, the event is ignored to avoid duplicates:

event_title_elem = event_page.find('span', class_='x1lliihq x6ikm8r x10wlt62 x1n2onr6')
if event_title_elem:
    event_title = event_title_elem.text.strip()
    # if any(calculate_similarity(event_title, existing_title) >= 90 for existing_title in unique_event_titles):
    if any(event_title == existing_title for existing_title in unique_event_titles):
        continue
else:
    continue

3. Location

The get_coordinates(location) function was applied,
it uses Nominatim to geocode a location description
(such as an address or city name) and return the corresponding geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

The function get_location_details(latitude, longitude) also uses Nominatim,
but this time to perform a geographic reversal, that is, based on geographic coordinates
(latitude and longitude), obtain additional details about the location, such as address, city and code of country.
